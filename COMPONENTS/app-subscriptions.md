# Subscriptions and Notifications

The creation and modification of linked open data allows for some subscribers to receive automatic notifications. This is for instance mandatory for some use cases of CLD's and useful in the use case of Authorisations. For Linked Data, the [`Linked Data Notifications`](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/) recommendation SHOULD be supported by any storage system chosen by the stakeholders, complemented by at least one subscription system.
